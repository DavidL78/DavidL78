Hi, I’m @DavidL78 (on Github).
I’m interested in testing (Quality Assurance) and software support.
I regularly review what I have learned in software development and testing (I obtained an Opquast and ISTQB Fundation certification).
I created an Ubuntu virtual machine (VMware Player) with a LAMP server.
I’m looking to work in testing or software support.

Thanks for read!
